# README-Generator

## Description

This is a node.js program that is meant to help streamline the process of generating a README file. It will take the user inputs like the project title, description, etc and then create a README in the README folder with with the infromation the user provided in the file. It will also accept the name of any picture that is put in the assets folder and add that to the README as well.

## Usage

Initiat the program by installing the needed npm packages. Specifically the inquire package. Then run the following code in the integrated terminal for script.js "node script.js" and you should be prompted with a series of questions. Answer the questions based on the information that you would pun in a README for your project. Then if it all worked you should see a console.log that says "success!". Now you should see a newly created README in the README folder with the infromation you put in the file. Note that if you would like to add a picture to your file to put the picture in the assets folder. Then copy the full file name and paste it into the terminal when prompted. As a best practice don't forget to add the alt text when prompted.
